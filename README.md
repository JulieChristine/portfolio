This application shows my personal work and is a way to present myself to you.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

<!-- Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
``` -->

Run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
